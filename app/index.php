                        <p>Christ Apostolic Church of Arthur, Tennessee was established in 1983 by a body of believers who desired to equip the saints and reach the lost. Since that time, it has grown from a small group meeting in a family home to a community with the common goals to love God and love people with all of our heart, mind, soul and strength.</p>
                        <p> In the early 1990’s the doing business name of the church was changed to Spirit and Truth Worship Center, in a desire to reaffirm the idea that we are the temple of the Holy Ghost and that this building is to worship God and educate the body of Christ.</p>
                        <p> “God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” John 4:24.</p>
                        <p> Spirit and Truth Worship Center is a family of believers living each day in worship, filled with the Spirit, and sharing the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our motto is “Apostolics in the Gap.” “And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap…” Ezekiel 22:30.</p>

                              <h3>About the Bible</h3>
                              <p>The Bible is the infallible Word of God and the authority for salvation and Christian living. (See II Timothy 3:15-17.)</p>

                              <h3>About God</h3>
                              <p>There is one God, who has revealed Himself as our Father, in His Son Jesus Christ, and as the Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ is God manifested in flesh. He is both God and man. (See Deuteronomy 6:4; Ephesians 4:4-6; Colossians 2:9; I Timothy 3:16.)</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                              <h3>About Sin and Salvation</h3>
                              <p>Everyone has sinned and needs salvation. Salvation comes by grace through faith based on the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. (See Romans 3:23-25; 6:23; Ephesians 2:8-9.)</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                              <h3>About the Gospel</h3>
                              <p>The saving gospel is the good news that Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and rose again. We obey the gospel (II Thessalonians 1:8; I Peter 4:17) by repentance (death to sin), water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ (burial), and the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the initial sign of speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives the utterance (resurrection). (See I Corinthians 15:1-4; Acts 2:4, 37-39; Romans 6:3-4.)</p>

                        <div>
                              <h3>About Christian Living</h3>
                              <p>As Christians we are to love God and others. We should live a holy life inwardly and outwardly, and worship God joyfully. The supernatural gifts of the Spirit, including healing, are for the church today. (See Mark 12:28-31; II Corinthians 7:1; Hebrews 12:14; I Corinthians 12:8-10.)</p>

                        <div>
                              <h3>About the Future</h3>
                              <p>Jesus Christ is coming again to catch away His church. In the end will be the final resurrection and the final judgment. The righteous will inherit eternal life, and the unrighteous eternal death. (See I Thessalonians 4:16-17; Revelation 20:11-15.)</p>

With this in mind we continue to improve on the things we have been doing and prepare to adopt the ones we have not. Not only is our focus that our students receive a good education, but that they receive an excellent education.</p>
